        <h3 id="about">About</h3>
        <p><br>Welcome to “The Vacationist Lifestyle Blog" to which I got inspired during my research about programming languages, website building tools and website hosting. I want to document my every day after my coming back from my vacation break in 2021/2022 to encourage everyone, who feels like needing a break to take it for themselves. So much changed for me due to this off-time…<br>
            But first of all, who am I?<br>
            I was born and raised in Germany, where I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with a M.Sc. Energy Technology. Later I graduated in a part-time study in M.A. Executive Management in the time of working as an engineer in Vienna, Austria. During my academic life, I had the privilege of experiencing life abroad in Atwater (California), Beijing (China), and Valencia (Spain) and developed an inspiring, international friend circle. Therefore, traveling was the best medicine for me to get out of the pressures of Corona… I found the needed rest in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, and flourished in my hobbies of running, singing, well, and eating out, if this counts as a hobby…</p>

        <p><br>I am thrilled to hear from you! <br>
